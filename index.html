                    The one ring was forged in Mount Doom by <button onclick="openOverlay('overlay_three')"> Sauron</button> in the Second Age to create a ring that had all-encompassing power. The story puts us in the scene of Smeagol, or Gollum, discovering the ring. This seals the fate for Bilbo and Frodo. The ring causes the wearer to become addicted or seemingly possessed by the desire to possess the ring, which is what changed Smeagol into the creature Gollum.

Surviving in deep caves and pits they multiply to do the bidding of evil forces. They destroy the world that they live in as violence is their nature. Notable orcs are Azgog and the Pale Orc.
